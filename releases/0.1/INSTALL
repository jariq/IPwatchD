IPwatchD installation
---------------------

Decompress and unpack the archive:

    bunzip2 ipwatchd-0.1.tar.bz2
    tar -xvf ipwatchd-0.1.tar
    
Copy file "ipwatchd" into some directory in your PATH:

    cd ipwatchd-0.1
    cp ipwatchd /usr/local/sbin

You can try to run as root

    ipwatchd --help
    
to get more information about program usage.
If you get many errors complaining about missing perl modules,
you must fulfil the requirements. (see below)


IPwatchD requirements
---------------------

Perl is required to run IPwatchD - it is included in almost every distro.

You also need to install two additional modules for perl - Net::Pcap and NetPacket

You can install it using automatic tools that provides perl by running:

    perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::Pcap'
    perl -MCPAN -e 'install NetPacket'

Or you can download these modules from www.cpan.org and then build each one of them
with commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Arping from iputils package is required for active mode of daemon.
