IPwatchD - IP conflict detection in Linux systems

Usage: ipwatchd -i device [-p [-u username -g groupname]]

-i device         Device that should be monitored/protected
-p                Passive mode (conflicts are only logged)
-u username       Run daemon as unprivileged user
-g groupname      and unprivileged group

or     ipwatchd -v|-h

-v, --version     Prints program version
-h, --help        Displays this help message

If IPwatchD running in active mode (default) detects gratuitous
ARP request with IP address of monitored interface (IP conflict)
it immediately sends ARP reply to the conflicting host and also
gratuitous ARP request to update cache of neighbouring hosts
on local network.

This version of IPwatchD uses arping from iputils package to send
ARP packets in active mode.
