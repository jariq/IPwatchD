IPwatchD requirements
---------------------

IPwatchD can be built as a pure daemon (useful for servers without
X Window System) or with desktop notification support.

To build IPwatchD from source code you will need gcc, libpcap 
and libnet1 installed in your system. For desktop notification 
support you will also need libnotify.

On Ubuntu 8.04 it should be sufficient to install following packages:

  - build-essential - C compiler and other development tools
  - libpcap-dev     - Network packet capture library
  - libnet1-dev     - Network packet construction library
  - libnotify-dev   - Desktop notification library
