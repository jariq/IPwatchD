#               protection mode for them.
#
#               In manual mode it is up to administrator to specify

#               In active protection mode IPwatchD protects your host
#               before IP takeover by answering Gratuitous ARP requests
#               received from conflicting system.
#
#               In passive protection mode it just records information
#               about IP conflict through standard syslog interface.
#
# Required:     No.
#
# Example:      iface eth0 active
#
# Restriction:  Interface must exist and protection mode must be
#               passive or active.
