IPwatchD 1.0 requirements
-------------------------

To build IPwatchD from source code you will need gcc (C compiler),
libpcap (network packet capture library) and libnet1 (network
packet construction library) installed in your system.

On Ubuntu 7.04 it should be enough to install three packages:
build-essential, libpcap-dev and libnet1-dev.


IPwatchD 1.0 installation
-------------------------

Download IPwatchD 1.0 source from sourceforge project page.

Extract code and build it:
$ bunzip2 ipwatchd-1.0.tar.bz2
$ tar -xf ipwatchd-1.0.tar
$ cd ipwatchd-1.0/src
$ make

Install IPwatchD as a root with command:
# make install

IPwatchD executable is installed into /usr/local/sbin
and the configuration file is copied into /usr/local/etc.

Edit configuration file /usr/local/etc/ipwatchd.conf with
your favourite editor to suite your needs.

Run IPwatchD as root with command:
# /usr/local/sbin/ipwatchd -c /usr/local/etc/ipwatchd.conf
